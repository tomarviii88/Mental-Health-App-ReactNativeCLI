# Mental Health App

## Problem Statement

In this competitive, fast paced, age of computers it's very easy for people to fall prey to _stress_, _anxiety_, _anger_, _depression_, _low self-esteem_ to name a few. Mental health is an issue which has certain stigma about it and is easily discarded and ignored.
**_Especially in this Covid pandemic, when most of the countries went into lockdown, it is very easy for people to feel alienated, unmotivated and stressed which when coupled with anxiety, overthinking and irritation have led few to self-harm with some even losing their lives to mental health._**

## Inspiration

Mental health apps can be effective in providing guidance in lifestyle and motivation to get relief from mental health issues and also making therapy more accessible, efficient, and portable. Many apps are available in the market for mental health but after researching we found that **most were either specific to some particular mental health issues or just weren’t an ‘all-rounder’ app.**

# Happy Birds

Happy Birds aims to be a **‘one-stop-shop’** app for mental health. From **music to a happy little chatbot to talk with, daily doses of inspirational quotes to constantly lift your spirits up, lifestyle guidance curated issue-wise and games to destress or release your anger**, Happy Birds wants to make its users find all available ways to make themselves ‘happy’.
